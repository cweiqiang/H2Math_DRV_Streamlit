Using Python and Streamlit to design interactive no-code Web App activities for Mathematics topics
This interactive Streamlit web app is designed for junior college (JC) students to experiment with discrete random variables through data visualisation and analysis in H2 Mathematics. The web app is currently hosted on Streamlit: https://cweiqiang-h2math-drv-streamlit-h2math-drv-stvkw9.streamlit.app/

The web app (no-code) can also be used by JC Mathematics educators for in-class activities, the Python/Streamlit shared code can also be customised for own teaching & learning needs.

This interactive Streamlit web app is designed for JC students to experiment with discrete random variables through data visualisation and analysis in H2 Mathematics.

The web app (no-code) can also be used by JC Mathematics educators for in-class activities, the Python/Streamlit shared code can also be customised for own teaching & learning needs in other Mathematics and Statistical topics.
